      <p class="AboutUs">
        Simon and I are both students at the Marcelle-Mallet school. We both
        desire to deepen our knowledge of coding, and are taking classes to
        further enhance our capabilities. Gab has learned two languages until
        now, HTML and CSS. Simon has a little bit more experience, knowing how
        to code in python, C# and javascript. This is Simon's first published
        video game and this is Gab's first official webpage. We truly hope to
        continue our journey towards becoming professional programmers.
