        <p class="AboutUs">
            Simon and I are both students at the Marcelle-Mallet school. We both
            desire to deepen our knowledge of coding, and are taking classes to
            further enhance our capabilities. Gab has learned two languages until
            now, HTML and CSS. Simon has a little bit more experience, knowing how
            to code in python, C# and javascript. This is Simon's first published
            video game and this is Gab's first official webpage. We truly hope to
            continue our journey towards becoming professional programmers.
